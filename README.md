# Stealth Auto Highlight

## About

This mod allows you to automatically highlight enemies without the need of aiming at them with a scope **when using the "High Value Target" aced ability**.

Based on [pd2-bipod-auto-highlighting](https://github.com/powware/pd2-bipod-auto-highlighting) but modified to only apply on stealth.

## Disabling stealth-only

If you want to use outside of stealth, you have to remove line 9 located in [`main.lua`](main.lua#L9=).
